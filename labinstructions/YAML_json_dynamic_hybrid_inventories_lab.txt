Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to build inventory from dynamic sources. Scripts may be used to perform lookups within databases, parse files, query APIs, as well as pull from other sources, to ultimately construct an inventory that Ansible may use to run against.

Within cloud environments, users can build and delete virtual machines too rapidly to record changes manually within an inventory file. Therefore, one popular application of dynamic inventorying, is when working with clouds such as Amazon (AWS) as well as OpenStack.

Here are some terms to add to your vocabulary:
Static Inventory - Users manually describe hosts within inventories
Dynamic Inventory - Scripts (with Python being the popular go to) are used to pull data from various sources
Hybrid Inventory - A combination of static and dynamic inventory techniques

Acceptable formats for inventories are:
- ini
- JSON
- YAML
- Comma separated host lists

Examples of 'comma separated hosts' lists include:

    # define 2 hosts in command line
    # ansible -i '10.10.2.6, 10.10.2.4' -m ping all

    # DNS resolvable names
    # ansible -i 'host1.example.com, host2' -m user -a 'name=me state=absent' all

    # just use localhost
    # ansible-playbook -i 'localhost,' play.yml -c local

Procedure
We'll be using the planetexpress team for this lab! Run the command below to prepare your environment.

student@bchd:~$ bash ~/px/scripts/full-setup.sh

If this is the first time running the setup script, you may see a pink screen come up regarding a newer kernel available. Just hit the Enter key to continue.

We're going to describe the planetexpress group via an inventory, only using the YAML format. Remember, YAML is JSON and JSON is YAML. Therefore, transcribing our INI format to YAML is a huge step in producing an inventory with JSON as well. Make a new directory we can store our YAML inventories in.

student@bchd:~$ mkdir -p ~/mycode/inv/yaml/

Create a ~/mycode/inv/yaml/hosts.yaml file.

student@bchd:~$ vim ~/mycode/inv/yaml/hosts.yaml

Create the following YAML file:

---
all:
  hosts:
    # if you had ungrouped hosts
    # describe them here
    # 10.10.2.2:
    # 10.10.1.1:
  children: 
    planetexpress:
      hosts:
        bender:
          ansible_host: 10.10.2.3
          ansible_user: bender
        fry:
          ansible_host: 10.10.2.4
          ansible_user: fry
        zoidberg:
          ansible_host: 10.10.2.5
          ansible_user: zoidberg
        farnsworth:
          ansible_host: 10.10.2.6
          ansible_user: farnsworth
          dnsip: 9.9.9.9
      vars:
        dnsip: 8.8.8.8
        ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
        ansible_ssh_pass: alta3
Save and exit.

Ensure your copy of ansible.cfg is accurate.

student@bchd:~$ vim ~/.ansible.cfg

Your file should reflect the following values:

[defaults]
# default location of inventory
# this can be a file or a directory
inventory = /home/student/mycode/inv/dev/
# prevents playbook from hanging on new connections
host_key_checking = no
Save and exit.

Run an Ansible Ad-Hoc command to proof-of-concept our YAML inventory file.

student@bchd:~$ ansible all -i ~/mycode/inv/yaml/hosts.yaml -m ping

bender | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
fry | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
zoidberg | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
farnsworth | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
You should see ping pong push and pull responses from each of the four hosts described within the YAML inventory.

Scripts may also be used to produce inventories, however, scripts will typically produce JSON. It's easier than it sounds. Create a new directory we can use to store our script.

student@bchd:~$ mkdir -p ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/

Create a python script within the new directory.

student@bchd:~$ vim ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/inventory.py

Create the following script:

#!/usr/bin/python3
"""Alta3 Research || rzfeeser@alta3.com
   Dynamic Inventory script"""

## for accepting arguments from user at CLI
import argparse

## required for working with JSON (pystd. library)
import json

def main():
    # this is what we will ultimately return
    inventory = {}

    # Called with `--list`
    if args.list:
        # inventory is result of calling example_inventory()
        inventory = example_inventory()
    # Called with `--host [hostname]`
    elif args.host:
        # Not implemented, since we return _meta info `--list`
        # Let's put API request logic here...
        inventory = empty_inventory()
    # If no groups or vars are present, return an empty inventory.
    else:
        inventory = empty_inventory()

    # print the result of inventory
    print(json.dumps(inventory))  # from the json library use the
                                  # DUMPString function, dumps()

# Example inventory for testing.
def example_inventory():
    return {
        'group': {
            'hosts': ['bender', 'fry'],
            'vars': {
                'example_var1': 'proxyeast',
                'example_var2': 'proxywest',
                'ansible_ssh_pass': 'alta3',
                'ansible_python_interpreter': '/usr/bin/python3'
            }
        },
        '_meta': {
            'hostvars': {
                'bender': {
                    'ansible_user': 'bender',
                    'ansible_host': '10.10.2.3'
                },
                'fry': {
                    'ansible_user': 'fry',
                    'ansible_host': '10.10.2.4'
                }
            }
        }
    }

# Empty inventory for testing.
def empty_inventory():
    return {'_meta': {'hostvars': {}}}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--list', action = 'store_true')
    parser.add_argument('--host', action = 'store')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main()
Save and exit.

Make the script, ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/inventory.py executable.

student@bchd:~$ chmod u+x ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/inventory.py

In the above script, we hard coded some json within example_inventory(). In production, we would want our script to make an API call, or parse some file. If you're new to Python, start studying the latest Python3.x release. If you want to jump-start your learning of making API requests with Python3, study the requests library. To access the hard-coded JSON inventory within our script, just run the script with the --list parameter.

student@bchd:~$ python3 ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/inventory.py --list

{"group": {"hosts": ["bender", "fry"], "vars": {"example_var1": "proxyeast", "example_var2": "proxywest", "ansible_ssh_pass": "alta3", "ansible_python_interpreter": "/usr/bin/python3"}}, "_meta": {"hostvars": {"bender": {"ansible_user": "bender", "ansible_host": "10.10.2.3"}, "fry": {"ansible_user": "fry", "ansible_host": "10.10.2.4"}}}}
Now try using your script to generate an inventory for an Ansible Ad-Hoc command. It won't matter that our ansible inventory is described as a differently in ~/.ansible.cfg as CLI options always override other settings. Notice that the --list parameter is no longer needed. That is because Ansible automatically calls all script with this parameter.

student@bchd:~$ ansible all -m ping -i ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/inventory.py

bender | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
fry | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
Try it again, this time, target just fry. In running this second command, understand that inventory.py is providing the potential candidates, much like the static hosts file provides. However, we still must select the individual host(s) from that candidate list.

student@bchd:~$ ansible fry -m ping -i ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/inventory.py

Let's build a hybrid inventory by adding a static file to our directory ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/

student@bchd:~$ vim ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/hostszoidfarns.yaml

Create the following YAML file.

---
all:
  hosts:
    zoidberg:
      ansible_host: 10.10.2.5
      ansible_user: zoidberg
      ansible_ssh_pass: alta3
    farnsworth:
      ansible_host: 10.10.2.6
      ansible_user: farnsworth
      ansible_ssh_pass: alta3
Save and exit.

Run the Ansible Ad-Hoc command again, only this time, specify the directory ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/ the expected behavior is that ansible will read all of the files, and execute the script(s), found within the directory. Any encountered scripts will be run with the --list parameter.

student@bchd:~$ ansible all -m ping -i ~/mycode/inv/hybridinv/

Some files extensions can be ignored. This behavior is configurable within ~/.ansible.cfg.

That's it for this lab. If you tracking your work on an SCM, perform the following operations.

cd ~/mycode
git status
git add /home/student/mycode/*
git commit -m "dynamic inventory"
git push origin
cd ~/
